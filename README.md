# LibraryProject
A simple microservices architecture to manage a library.
There are 3 main services:
1. Catalog Service: anyone can view all books in the library's catalog and their state
2. Rental Service: any authenticated user can rent an available book in the library and then return it
3. Reviews Service: anyone can add a review for a book in the library
